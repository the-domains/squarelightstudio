Square Light Studio and the kids.

It's always exciting to have an amazing kid on the set. We love working with kids although there is nothing more difficult. To capture the right moment can take hundreds of shots simply because children will not wait for you and your camera. Gear has to be fast and ready. Overshoot and later when editing you just go through the shots to find the one shot where you captured the right expression, smile, energy and excitement. Here are some of our favorite ones.
